My name is Keyawna Williams.
I'm double majoring in computer science and sociology. This is my 4th year at Oregon State University.
I did sign up for Piazza.
Although, I'm 5'1'' I can play basketball and I'm really good at it. However, soccer is my favorite sport out of them all. What I plan on doing with my degree in computer science and sociology is possible working for the FBI or CIA in Cyber Security.
